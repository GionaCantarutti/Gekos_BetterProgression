//// GEKO'S BETTER PROGRESSION CONFIGURATION FILE ////
//
// Welcome to the config file. Nearly everything this mod does can be disabled or tweaked to your liking.
// You can find IDs for items and other things on https://moxopixel.com/tarkynator/. Failing that you can explore the SPT_Data/Server/database folder in your SPT installation to find the ID you need
// A few times "Deltas" are mentioned in this config file. Delta is a fancy word to mean "change", a negative delta will reduce a value and a positive one will increase it
// If you encounter any bugs please do let me know either on the GitHub page or as a comment on the SPT Hub page for the mod
